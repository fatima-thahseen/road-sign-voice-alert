# üö¶ Road Sign Detection and Voice Alert System

A real-time computer vision system that detects road signs through webcam, classifies them using a fine-tuned VGG16 model, and gives voice alerts ‚Äî just like a smart driver-assist system!

---

## Project Overview

This deep learning project identifies traffic signs using a webcam feed and notifies the user via voice alert using text-to-speech. It mimics a driver assistant by observing signs in real time and reacting only when predictions are stable ‚Äî just like a patient human.

---

## Features

- Real-time webcam-based road sign detection using OpenCV  
- VGG16-based traffic sign classifier (Transfer Learning)  
- Voice alerts using pyttsx3  
- Buffer logic: speaks only if 3 out of last 5 frames agree  
- FPS overlay for performance monitoring

## Model Info

- **Backbone**: VGG16 pretrained on ImageNet  
- **Dataset**: GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)  
- **Training**: Used `ImageDataGenerator` with augmentation  
- **Architecture**: Fine-tuned with additional dense + dropout layers  
- **Accuracy**: High validation performance and stable real-time results

## üì¶ Dataset Preparation

The script [`dataset_preparation.py`](dataset_preparation.py) is used to:
- Crop signs using ROI data from the GTSRB dataset
- Resize images to 160√ó160
- Split the dataset into training and validation sets
